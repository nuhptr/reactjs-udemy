1. React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user 
interfaces simpler.
- React is all about "components"

2. What is components?
reusable block in your user interface.

3. Why components?
- Reusability (don't repeat yourself)
- Separations of concerns (don't do too many things in one and 
  the same place (function))

"Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions"

4. How components built?
combining from html and javascript and least css

"React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components
consisting of HTML and Javascript (and CSS)" 
=> 
Declarative Approach
Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the
actual javascript DOM Instruction.
